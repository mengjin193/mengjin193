## Some thoughts on how to utilize GitHub

-- to make myself a better person.

Like many people, I started coding by learning JAVA. I then had a college course in software development using HTML and CSS, but failed to continue with Node.js. 
As a math major, I also use a lot of LaTeX for homework and essays.
However, during and after grad school, as I go further with probability & statistics, I focused more on R, Rmd, SQL, and Python. 
Then these projects are always pulling complementary information that I would never be able to revisit and share.
I am gradually losing my knowledge of some programming languages. Though I probably will never use them in my career anymore, I see this as a pity. I should have remembered more, as a part of me. 

I am planning to go through my old college work and sort it out into small pieces on GitHub, not only refreshing my knowledge but also reminding me of my lovely college life.
